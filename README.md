## Project 01

Learn Nest.js from Scratch by building an API by [Academind](https://youtu.be/F_oOtaxb0L8) - Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

Rest API - local storage

In this tutorial we learn how to handle simple endpoints with basic local data storage.
In my opinion Max is a decent teacher. This tutorial was contentfull and fun to code with. Definetly worth to take!

## Project 02

NestJS Crash Course by [Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/wqhNoDE6pb4) - Brad Traversy.

Rest API - local storage + mongo DB

This course has same length as the first one. It explains how to create simple REST API with CRUD operations in local storage and mongoDB. At first glance we might think that it gives you more content, and yes in some way it's true, but in my personal opinion Max explained the foundations bit more deeply. Even tho I reccomend to take this tutorial - it was fun, quick and smooth and Brad is wonderful teacher as well!
