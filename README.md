# Hello World of Nest.js

---

> This repo contains few small Nest.js projects. The goal is get to know with this framework.

The goal is to create few projects with some tutorials from the internet.

## Project 01

Learn Nest.js from Scratch by building an API by [Academind](https://youtu.be/F_oOtaxb0L8) - Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

In this tutorial we learn how to handle simple endpoints with basic local data storage.
In my opinion Max is a decent teacher. This tutorial was contentfull and fun to code with. Definetly worth to take!

## Project 02

NestJS Crash Course by [Traversy Media](https://youtu.be/wqhNoDE6pb4) - Brad Traversy.
